The Whose Hoo Bird Feeder is an innovative device designed to provide bird enthusiasts with a better understanding of the bird population in their yard. By combining embedded technologies, such as a BeagleBone Black microcontroller, microphone, camera, beam break sensor, and a Wi-Fi module, this bird feeder offers a hands-free, automated birding experience.

## Features
**Bird Detection:** The beam break sensor detects the presence of birds at the feeder, triggering the camera to capture images of the birds. This allows users to log and document bird visits.

**Audio Recording:** The embedded system records audio during predetermined time intervals, capturing the sounds of birds calling in the vicinity of the feeder.

**Wireless Data Transfer:** The captured images and recorded audio are scurely transferred to the user's device through a user-friendly GUI application. This allows users to conveniently access and review the collected data.

**Bird Identification:** The transferred audio recordings are automatically analyzed using BirdNET-Analyzer, a powerful bird sound recognition software. Users can obtain detailed reports on the identified bird species, providing valuable insights into the types of birds frequenting the feeder.

**Visual Documentation:** Along with the bird identification reports, users can also view the captured images of the birds that visited the feeder. This visual documentation enhances the overall bird-watching experience.

With the Embedded Bird Feeder, users can gain a deeper understanding of the bird population in their yard, track the presence of specific bird species, and contribute to bird conservation efforts by collecting valuable data, without the need of constant user interaction and prior knowledge. It serves as a fascinating tool for both bird enthusiasts and researchers alike.
